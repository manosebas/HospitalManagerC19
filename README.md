# Diagnostic and Management System

## Description
This project involves the development of a COVID-19 diagnostic and management system utilizing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The system is designed to manage and register doctors and patients within a hospital setting, focusing on the current real-world context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The application allows for the input and management of patient data, including a series of diagnostic questions related to COVID-19 symptoms. These questions are answered on a scale of 1 to 10, assessing symptoms like throat pain, fatigue, and breathing difficulty. The system then calculates an average score to estimate the likelihood of infection.

The project features robust data management capabilities, with patients stored as objects within the system, allowing for easy retrieval and manipulation of data. The backend supports data storage in JSON or CSV formats, ensuring flexibility and ease of integration. The code is structured according to MVC principles, ensuring a clean separation between the user interface, data models, and control logic.

## Features
- **Patient and Doctor Management:** Register and manage patient and doctor records efficiently.
- **COVID-19 Diagnostic Evaluation:** Assess potential infection risks through a series of symptom-related questions.
- **Data Storage Flexibility:** Supports JSON or CSV for backend data storage.
- **MVC Architecture:** Ensures a clear separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

## Code and Documentation
The source code, along with UML diagrams and other project documentation, is available on GitHub. The repository demonstrates the full functionality of the system, including:
- Patient and doctor registration
- Data management
- Diagnostic evaluation

## Additional Resources
The GitHub repository includes the complete code for you to understand and provide insights into the system's architecture and design decisions. These resources are valuable for understanding how the system manages and processes data, and how the MVC architecture is implemented.
